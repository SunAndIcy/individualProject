### About the Feature

Our car rental system has fully encapsulated the core interfaces and functionalities. This means that users can easily interact with the system whether it's through a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This encapsulation brings several advantages:

- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Encapsulation of core functionalities makes the system more flexible and scalable. We can seamlessly switch between interaction modes, from CLI to GUI, without needing to modify the core functionalities.
  
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** With the core functionalities already encapsulated, future development efforts can focus solely on designing and optimizing the interface, significantly saving on development costs and time.
  
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can choose the interaction mode that best suits their preferences and habits, thereby enhancing user experience and satisfaction.

This approach allows our car rental system to operate flexibly in different environments and scenarios, providing users with consistent, high-quality service.
